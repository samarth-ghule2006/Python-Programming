# Single-Level Inheritance

class Parent:
    def func1(self):
        print("This function is in parent class.")

class Child(Parent):
    def func2(self):
        print("This function is in child class.")

obj = Child()
obj.func1()
obj.func2()

#Explanation:
#The Child class inherits the method func1() from Parent.
#It also has its own method func2().
#This shows how one class can extend another using single inheritance.
