class Parent:
    def func1(self):
        print("This function is in parent class")
        
class Child1(Parent):
    def func2(self):
        print("This function is in child 1")
        
class Child2(Parent):
    def func3(self):
        print("This function is in child 2")
        
object1 = Child1()
object2 = Child2()
object1.func1()
object1.func2()
object2.func1()
object2.func3()

#Explanation:

#Both Child1 and Child2 inherit from the same Parent class.
#Each child can access the func1() method of Parent, but also has its own specific method.
#This pattern is useful when multiple classes need the same base functionality but also have unique behaviors.
